This is a simple serverless application built in Java. It consists of an
[Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) backed by four [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
functions and an [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) table for storage.

## Requirements

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)
- Java 11
- Maven
- [Artillery](https://www.artillery.io/) for load-testing the application

## Software

Within the software folder is the products maven project. This single maven project contains all the code for all four
Lambda functions. It uses the hexagonal architecture pattern to decouple the entry points, from the main domain logic
and the storage logic.

### Build

Build the software with Maven

```bash
mvn clean package
```

## Infrastructure

### Deployment

Deploy the demo to your AWS account using [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).

```bash
cdk deploy
```

The command `cdk deploy` will use the .jar file from the software folder. Then it will use AWS CloudFormation to deploy
the resources to your account.

CDK will create an output of the API Gateway endpoint URL for future use in our load tests.

## Load Test

[Artillery](https://www.artillery.io/) is used to make 300 requests / second for 10 minutes to our API endpoints. You
can run this with the following command.

```bash
cd load-test
./run-load-test.sh
```

This is a demanding load test, to change the rate alter the `arrivalRate` value in `load-test.yml`.

### CloudWatch Logs Insights

Using this CloudWatch Logs Insights query you can analyse the latency of the requests made to the Lambda functions.

The query separates cold starts from other requests and then gives you p50, p90 and p99 percentiles.

```
filter @type="REPORT"
| fields greatest(@initDuration, 0) + @duration as duration, ispresent(@initDuration) as coldStart
| stats count(*) as count, pct(duration, 50) as p50, pct(duration, 90) as p90, pct(duration, 99) as p99, max(duration) as max by coldStart
```
